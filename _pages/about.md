Hi, I'm Yue(Ariel) Wu. I'm a current PhD studnet at the University of Caliornia, Los Angeles primarily working with [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). My research interests lie at the interface of machine learning and computational bioinformatics. 


Previously, I have developed tools to perform large-scale inference on human genetics,and have also worked with GPS data and accelerometer data for physical activity analysis with an application in pschiactric disease prevention. The goal is to achieve precision medicine by intergrating human genetic information and machine learning techniques, where we could have targed treatment strategies that are developed for specific individuals and groups. Along my research journey, here are some key questions I'm interested:

How genetic variants contribute to disease and why?
======
We all get sick. But how genomics is related to the risk of disease? Let's zoom out and first look from an entire population point of view. Then the first question I ask is, what mutation in genes make us have a higher risk of certain disease(s) than others? Secondly, we often see discrepencies among populations of disease prevalence, reported associated genes to diseases, how do we interpret this?

What patients respone to treatments and why?
======
Predicting which patients will respond to treatment or develop harmful side-effects is a fundamental goal of precision medicine. We aim to integrate genetics and large-scale electronic health record data to identify meaningful biomarkers of treatment consequences and develop algorithmic models to support clinical decision-making.



What affects disease progress? 
======
Now we zoom into individuals. How do patients disease journey differ? Are there genetic factor that shape the disease progression trajectory? How enviromental factor or lifestyle -- which might affect our body, for example, through metabolism, that leads to different progression through time?
